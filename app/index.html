                            <p>Kerm.is is a website made by Bart Van Itterbeeck &amp; Robbert Wolfs. These two Web&amp;UX students wanted to do something with new web technology like WebGL, Three.js and socket.io. So they started Kerm.is, a website where you can play all kind of different carnival games.</p>
                            <p>They wanted to let the user expierence something totally new! What if the user can play a game with their smartphone as controller or just with their hands? To accomplisch this Bart &amp; Robbert used Node.js, websockets and a leap motion.</p>
                            <p>But why don’t they use a 3D program like Unity? Because Bart &amp; Robbert don’t like to install plugins and they wanted to learn new native, fancy, cool webtechnologies and not an old, dirty, ... language like C#. This would be a challenge they both looked forward to!</p>
                            <p>Quick, go and try these awesome games and be amazed with what the web can do these days!</p>
